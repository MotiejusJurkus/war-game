Define deck of 52 cards with suits

Create and shuffle deck

Deal the cards into to halves for the player and computer

Playing a round - both players play a card from the top of their deck. The higher value card wins both cards.

Handling war - if both card values are of equal value, we have WAR. When we have WAR both players play 4 cards from the top of their deck, first 3 face down and last one face up. The player higher card wins all of the cards. If the values are equal again, the WAR continues and is repeated.

Playing the game (Loop) - the rounds should loop until either the player or computer is out of cards. If a player does not have enough cards for WAR they also lose.
